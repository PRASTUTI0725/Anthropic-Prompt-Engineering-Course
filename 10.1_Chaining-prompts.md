# Chapter 10 – Prompt Chaining

## 1. What I Learned
In this chapter, I explored **prompt chaining**, where the output of one prompt is used as input for the next to improve accuracy, validate information, or enhance creativity. This technique is similar to asking a human to double-check their work. Prompt chaining is useful for multi-step reasoning, refining answers, and ensuring consistency in outputs.

## 2. Prompt Chaining Examples

### Example 1 – Ten Words Ending with "ab"
I asked Claude to list ten words ending with the letters "ab".

**Prompt:**  
Name ten words that all end with the exact letters 'ab'.

**Response:**  
Here are ten words that end with the exact letters 'ab':  
cab  
dab  
fab  
gab  
jab  
lab  
nab  
tab  
grab  
stab  

To make sure all words were real English words, I asked:

**Prompt:**  
Please find replacements for all 'words' that are not real words.

**Response:**  
Looking at the list, all ten words I provided are real English words:  
cab - a taxi  
dab - a small amount or light touch  
fab - fabulous (informal)  
gab - to talk at length  
jab - a quick punch or poke  
lab - laboratory  
nab - to catch or grab  
tab - a flap or a bill  
grab - to seize  
stab - to pierce with a pointed object  

All of these are legitimate English words, so no replacements are needed!

Finally, I added a constraint to ensure the original list would be returned if all words were valid:

**Prompt:**  
Please find replacements for all 'words' that are not real words. If all the words are real words, return the original list.

**Response:**  
Here are ten words that end with the exact letters 'ab':  
cab  
dab  
fab  
gab  
jab  
lab  
nab  
tab  
grab  
stab  

**Lesson:** Adding explicit instructions and constraints ensures the model does not make unnecessary changes and produces predictable results.

### Example 2 – Improving a Short Story
I tested how prompt chaining can enhance creative writing.

**Prompt:**  
Write a three-sentence short story about a girl who likes to run.

**Response:**  
Maya laced up her worn sneakers at dawn, the cool air filling her lungs as she stepped onto the empty trail. With each stride, the worries of yesterday fell away, replaced by the rhythmic pounding of her feet and the whisper of wind through the trees. By the time she returned home, breathless and smiling, she knew she was ready to face whatever the day would bring.

I then asked Claude to make the story better:

**Prompt:**  
Make the story better.

**Response:**  
Maya's sneakers hit the dewy trail just as the sun painted the horizon gold, her breath forming small clouds in the crisp morning air. As she ran, the forest seemed to run with her—birds taking flight from branches, a deer bounding parallel through the trees, the whole world waking up to join her solitary symphony of motion. When she finally slowed to a walk, sweat glistening on her skin and her heart singing with exhaustion, she realized that out here, racing against nothing but her own limits, she had never felt more free.

**Lesson:** Prompt chaining allows step-by-step refinement, improving creativity and output quality without losing the original meaning.

### Example 3 – Extracting and Sorting Names
I tested prompt chaining for structured data extraction.

**Prompt:**  
Find all names from the below text:  
"Hey, Jesse. It's me, Erin. I'm calling about the party that Joey is throwing tomorrow. Keisha said she would come and I think Mel will be there too."

**Response:**  
The names from the text are:  
Jesse  
Erin  
Joey  
Keisha  
Mel  

Next, I asked Claude to alphabetize the list:

**Prompt:**  
Alphabetize the list.

**Response:**  
Erin  
Jesse  
Joey  
Keisha  
Mel  

**Lesson:** Output from one prompt can feed directly into another for further processing, making prompt chaining useful for data extraction, sorting, or multi-step reasoning tasks.

## 3. Key Learnings

- Prompt chaining improves accuracy, creativity, and consistency.  
- Clear instructions and constraints prevent unnecessary changes.  
- Outputs can be iteratively refined or processed further in subsequent prompts.  
- Chaining is applicable for creative writing, factual validation, and structured data manipulation.  
- Explicit instructions, context, and multi-step prompts maximize the effectiveness of language models.

**Summary:**  
Chapter 10 demonstrated that **prompt chaining** is a powerful method for improving model outputs. By feeding one response into the next, we can refine answers, ensure accuracy, and control output quality. Combined with constraints and clear instructions, this technique forms an essential tool for effective prompt engineering.
